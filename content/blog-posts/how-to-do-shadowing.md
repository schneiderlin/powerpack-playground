what is shadowing practice, when it will be useful and how to do it to obtain maximum effect.

Shadowing is a language learning practice where you repeat a sentence after hearing it. At first glance, it may seem simple, but the timing and fluency required depend on one's current language level.

## max level
As a native Mandarin and Cantonese speaker, I can shadow a sentence without hesitation, repeating every word with only a 1-3 second delay.

To perform this level of shadowing effectively, one must possess a high level of fluency in the target language. This is because the response time required for exact repetition is extremely short, leaving little room for thinking and reacting. In fact, you may need to anticipate the next word before it's even been spoken.

For instance, when listening to someone say "in order," your brain might instinctively predict that the next word will be "to." This pattern recognition happens unconsciously, as languages often exhibit duplicative structures in sentences. When words are unclear or ambiguous, this unconscious process allows you to make educated guesses about what those words might be.

The brain operates like a pattern recognition machine, able to fill in missing information based on partial input. When presented with incomplete or ambiguous data, it can generate a plausible completion.

## intermediate level

my English skills are not as proficient. When listening to someone speak in English, I struggle to shadow exact words, especially phrases that are less common or unfamiliar. My brain needs to allocate more processing power for these unusual words, which slows down my ability to respond. If I actively "think" about the words instead of relying on subconscious patterns, a lag occurs and
I'm no longer able to follow the speaker's train of thought. However, when I don't consciously think about the words, my responses become mumbled.

However, this level of shadowing also requires a decent level of fluency in the target language. If the overall sound and sentence structure are unfamiliar to your subconscious, you won't be able to predict the next word or phrase. For example, when I hear something like "because xxxx," my brain can instinctively anticipate that the next word will be "so..." only because I'm familiar with this common English sentence structure.

how to practice in this level?

don't attempt to simultaneously listen and repeat. Instead, first hear the sentence, pause for a brief moment, and then try to repeat it exactly. You won't remember every detail after hearing the sentence only once, so focus on grasping the overall meaning. As you repeat the sentence, your
subconscious will fill in the gaps by predicting what words should come next. This process is similar to trying to convey a thought that originates from your own mind, but in this case, it's the original speaker's meaning that you're attempting to recreate.

import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from "@/components/ui/alert"

<Alert>
  <AlertTitle>Note</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Remember to avoid looking at the text while repeating the sentence. This is not a reading exercise, but rather training for subconscious processing.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

This practice can help alleviate the common issue where you can easily comprehend written or spoken language, but struggle with producing output in the target language. When trying to express yourself, you might find that you need to think first, possibly in your native language, and then translate it mentally before speaking or writing in the target language. Shadowing can help train your brain to process language more efficiently, allowing you to respond more naturally and
accurately.

## lower level

As someone who has only learned Indonesian for a month, my language proficiency is still developing. My active vocabulary consists of around 300-400 words, which is relatively small.

At my current Indonesian proficiency, I struggle to understand most sentences unless they contain common words and are spoken slowly. At this stage, the sound and meaning don't yet have an association in my mind. What's crucial for me is creating these associations. Unfortunately, shadowing isn't particularly helpful at this level, as it relies on a certain level of linguistic familiarity that I haven't yet developed.

At this stage, I believe that effective practices should focus on creating associations between textual, auditory, and visual signals. This can be achieved by reading text and listening to voiceovers for the same text, accompanied by visual representations of the meanings in the text. By doing so, my brain will learn to associate the three modalities and develop a stronger connection between them.
