A fundamental principle in achieving workplace satisfaction is aligning oneself with a meaningful purpose. Dedicating your efforts to a cause greater than yourself can instill a sense of fulfillment that transcends basic job contentment.

## Sources of Unhappiness
*Lack of Visible Impact*.
One of the primary reasons for unhappiness at work is the inability to see the impact of your efforts. When the downstream effects of your work seem insignificant or wasteful, it can lead to frustration and demotivation.

*Constrained Autonomy and Influence*
Typically, one's capacity for control and impact correlates with their organizational rank. This implies that pursuing roles with expanded responsibilities and greater influence may lead to enhanced job satisfaction.


## Actions
Exercise discernment in project selection. 
A more unconventional perspective views the company as a platform to leverage its resources for experimentation and personal goal attainment. 
Ideally, your objectives should harmonize with the company's mission, but maintain realistic expectations.
If you're treated as a mere cog in the machine, consider your options judiciously.
However, establishing a personal objective is paramount, whether it's cultivating valuable professional connections or acquiring new competencies.

Recognize that you always possess agency. The more obligations you face, the greater your potential for discontent; conversely, the more pursuits you willingly undertake, the greater your potential for satisfaction.
If your supervisor harbors unrealistic expectations, such as encouraging excessive overtime or demanding constant availability, remaining silent and harboring resentment is counterproductive. The onus is on you to voice your concerns and confront potential consequences. You retain the power to choose between available options. 
Accumulate a financial safety net and avoid becoming indispensable within your current organization; instead, strive to become irreplaceable in the broader job market.

Express your concerns openly. Don't hesitate to bring issues to your team's attention. Your leadership requires your candid opinions and factual observations to make well-informed decisions. Consider the worst-case scenario and weigh it against the potential benefits of speaking up.

While it may appear commendable, consistently assuming a heroic role at work can be detrimental. Such behavior often masks systemic issues, impeding necessary long-term solutions.
