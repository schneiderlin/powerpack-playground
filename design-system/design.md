Create a Wabi-Sabi inspired website theme with the following characteristics:

PHILOSOPHY:
- Embrace imperfection, asymmetry, and natural irregularity
- Honor empty space (Ma) - use generous whitespace as a design element
- Suggest organic decay/aging rather than pristine digital perfection
- Content-first: typography and breathing room over decoration

VISUAL TOKENS:
- Colors: Tea-stain paper (#F5F0E1), Charcoal ink (#2B2B2B), Moss green (#5F6B4E), 
  Indigo (#3B4A6B), Faded wood (#D4C4B5)
- Textures: Subtle paper grain CSS noise, watercolor edge fade, slight imperfections
- Typography: Serif for body (Noto Serif SC, Crimson Text), Monospace for code (JetBrains Mono)
- Layout: Asymmetric margins (not perfectly centered), varying section heights, 
  irregular grid gaps that feel organic rather than mechanical

INTERACTION:
- Slow, deliberate transitions (cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))
- Respect user focus - no flashing or aggressive animations
- Hover states that feel like ink spreading on paper (opacity shifts, not scale/transform)
